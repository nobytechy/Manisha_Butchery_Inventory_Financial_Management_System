## 📋 Overview

**Manisha Butchery** is a production-grade mobile application designed for butchery/meat processing businesses operating across multiple shop locations. The system provides real-time inventory tracking, inter-shop stock transfers, daily closing management, and comprehensive financial reporting.

Built with Flutter and SharedPreferences for local storage, this application demonstrates clean architecture, state management, and complex business logic implementation in a real-world context.

| 📱 | **Professional UI/UX** | Clean, intuitive interface with responsive design |
| 💾 | **Local-first architecture** | No internet required, data persisted locally |
